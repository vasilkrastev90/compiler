Compliments:

Skeleton for functions and programme as a set of functions provided in the parser. This will make exnending the parser to support functions easier.

Support for strings as a primitive type.

Nice error message for lexical errors.


Improvements:

The test suite could be enlarged to allow for better bug detection.

Expressions could be parsed as a syntax tree. So the parser could parse expressions of the form x+y/3*5

May be display code in markdown surounded be  ``` anotations. This will give better indication of where code is.
